# sasquatch (development version)

## rOpenSci Review Changes

- `configure_saspy()` no longer asks that users type in their SAS ODA username and password within the terminal. See `vignette("secrets", "httr")`.  
- Dataset used to show `sas_to_r()` in `README.md` changed to `warpbreaks` and the variable name of the version of `"sashelp.cars"` was renamed to `sas_cars`.
- Fixed typo in `configure_saspy()`. Changed Europe 2 to Europe 1.  
- Specified `rlang` imports.  
- Added a Code of Conduct.
