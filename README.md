# sasr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

why choose between R and SAS when you can have them both?

## Installation

You can install the development version of sasr like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("ryanzomorrodi/sasr")
```

`sasr` is currently in a very rudimentary form, but it is not hard to
use once you have [`saspy`](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/)
installed and set up. Feel free to contribute by adding an issue or pull
request.

Donâ€™t have a SAS License? You can still set up saspy with [SAS OnDemand
for
Academics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html#928a7e06-1416-4d88-b966-311df1bdfea6).
