Use SAS, R, and Quarto Together

`sasquatch` allows you to combine the power of R, SAS, and quarto
together to create reproducible multilingual reports. `sasquatch` can:

- Run SAS code blocks interactively
- Send data back and forth between SAS and R
- Conduct basic file management on a SAS client
- Render SAS output within quarto documents.

`sasquatch` relies on the
[`SASPy`](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/) Python package and the
`reticulate` R package to interoperate with Python. Check out
`vignette("configuration")` for guidance on `SASPy` configuration.

## Installation

#### Package installation

You can install the development version of sasquatch like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("ryanzomorrodi/sasquatch")
```

#### Python installation

Make sure Python is installed on your system. If Python has not been
installed, you can install Python like so:

``` r
reticulate::install_python()
```

or download the installer from the [Python Software
Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads').

#### `SASPy` installation

To install the `SASPy` package and its dependencies within a Python
virutal environment:

``` r
sasquatch::install_saspy()
```

See `vignette("configuration")` for guidance on `SASPy` configuration.

## Usage

Once you have setup `SASPy` and connected to the right python
environment using `reticulate` (if necessary), you can create a quarto
document like any other, call `sas_connect()`, and just get going!

```` default
---
format: html
engine: knitr
---

```{r}
library(sasquatch)
sas_connect()
```

```{sas}

```
````

#### Code blocks

Now, you should be able to run SAS code blocks in RStudio like any
other.

#### Sending output to viewer

If you want to send the SAS output to the viewer, you can utilize the
`sas_run_selected()` addin with a custom shortcut.

#### Converting tables

Pass tables between R and SAS with `sas_from_r()` and `sas_to_r()`.

``` r
sas_from_r(mtcars, "mtcars")
cars <- sas_to_r("cars", libref = "sashelp")
```

#### Rendering quarto documents

And of course, render beautiful quarto documents in the same style you
would expect from SAS with the `sas_engine()`.

## Comparison with similar packages

[`sasr`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/sasr)

- `sasr` works identically to `sasquatch` relying on the `SASPy` Python
  package to interface with SAS, but does not include any interactive,
  file management, or quarto functionality.

[`configSAS`](https://github.com/baselr/configSAS)

- Like `sasr` and `sasquatch`, `configSAS` relies on the `SASPy` Python
  package, but it primarily focuses on solely on `knitr` engine support.
- The `configSAS` engine HTML output CSS styles interfere with the rest
  of the document and SAS code output is not contained within a code
  block.

[`SASmarkdown`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SASmarkdown/index.html)

- `SASmarkdown` does not rely on the `SASPy` Python package and thus is
  fairly simple to set up; however, it does require a SAS executable to
  be installed on the same machine as R.
- In contrast, `SASPy`-reliant packages can interface with both local
  and remote SAS installations and can easily pass data between R and
  SAS without the need for intermediate files.
- `SASmarkdown` features several different engines for various formats
  not currently implemented within `sasquatch` like latex pdfs or
  non-HTML5 HTML.

`sasquatch` may be beneficial to you if youâ€¦

- Rely on remote SAS client  
- Desire interactive SAS functionality while developing  
- Require remote SAS file management  
- Would like to be able to easily send data back and forth between SAS
  and R  
  without the use of intermediate files

If you require pdf `knitr` support and have a local installation of SAS,
I would recommend using `SASmarkdown`at this time.
