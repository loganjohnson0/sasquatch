Use SAS, R, and Quarto together

`sasquatch` allows you to combine the power of R, SAS, and quarto together
to create reproducable multilingual reports. `sasquatch` can run SAS code blocks
interactively, send data back and forth between SAS and R, and render SAS HTML 
output within quarto documents.

Don't have a SAS License? You can still set up SASPy with [SAS OnDemand for Academics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html#928a7e06-1416-4d88-b966-311df1bdfea6). Check out
`vignette("setting_up")` for how to get started with SAS ODA and `sasquatch`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sasquatch like so:

```{r eval = FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("ryanzomorrodi/sasquatch")
```

## Usage

Once you have setup `SASPy` and connected to the right python environment using
`reticulate` (if necessary), use `sas_use_quarto()` to create the `sasquatch` 
template to a specified directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sasquatch::sas_use_quarto("path to directory")
```

Run the first code block within the template.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sasquatch)
sas_connect()
```

#### Code blocks

Now, you should be able to run SAS code blocks in RStudio like any other.

#### Sending output to viewer

If you want to send the SAS output to the viewer, you can utilize the 
`sas_run_selected()` addin with a custom shortcut.

#### Converting tables

Pass tables between R and SAS with `r_to_sas()` and `sas_to_r()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
r_to_sas(mtcars, "mtcars")
cars <- sas_to_r("cars", libref = "sashelp")
```

#### Rendering quarto documents

And of course, render beautiful quarto documents in the same style you would
expect from SAS with the `sas_engine()`.
