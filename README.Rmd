Use SAS, R, and Quarto together

`sasquatch` allows you to combine the power of R, SAS, and quarto together
to create reproducable multilingual reports. `sasquatch` can run SAS code blocks
interactively, send data back and forth between SAS and R, and render SAS HTML 
output within quarto documents.

`sasquatch` relies on the [`SASPy`](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/) Python package. But if you

- Don't have `SASPy` already installed, or  
- Don't have a SAS License  

Check out `vignette("setting_up")` for guidance on how to get started with a 
free [SAS OnDemand for Academics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics)
license (you don't need to be an academic!).

## Installation

You can install the development version of sasquatch like so:

```{r eval = FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("ryanzomorrodi/sasquatch")
```

## Usage

Once you have setup `SASPy` and connected to the right python environment using
`reticulate` (if necessary), use `sas_use_quarto()` to create the `sasquatch` 
template to a specified directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sasquatch::sas_use_quarto("path to directory")
```

Run the first code block within the template.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sasquatch)
sas_connect()
```

#### Code blocks

Now, you should be able to run SAS code blocks in RStudio like any other.

#### Sending output to viewer

If you want to send the SAS output to the viewer, you can utilize the 
`sas_run_selected()` addin with a custom shortcut.

#### Converting tables

Pass tables between R and SAS with `r_to_sas()` and `sas_to_r()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
r_to_sas(mtcars, "mtcars")
cars <- sas_to_r("cars", libref = "sashelp")
```

#### Rendering quarto documents

And of course, render beautiful quarto documents in the same style you would
expect from SAS with the `sas_engine()`.

## Similar packages

`saquatch` works similarly to packages like [`sasr`](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/) 
or [`configSAS`](https://github.com/baselr/configSAS). In fact, `configSAS` 
author [Johann Laurent's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c9T6-__vI8) at a 
useR! event inspired `sasquatch`'s creation. `sasr`, while similar to 
`sasquatch`, does not include interactive SAS functionality or a `knitr` engine. 
On the other hand, `configSAS` includes a `knitr` engine, but no interactive SAS 
functionality. `configSAS` `knitr` output also does not include syntax 
highlighting and nested SAS output interferes with the styles of the rest of the
document.
