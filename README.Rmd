# sasquatch

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

why choose between R and SAS when you can have them both?

## Installation

You can install the development version of sasquatch like so:

```{r}
pak::pkg_install("ryanzomorrodi/sasquatch")
```

`sasquatch` is currently in a very rudimentary form, but it is not hard to use once
you have [`saspy`](https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/) installed and set up.
Feel free to contribute by adding an issue or pull request.

Don't have a SAS License? You can still set up saspy with [SAS OnDemand for Academics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html#928a7e06-1416-4d88-b966-311df1bdfea6).
